Hi! I'm James Randle Jr.

I'm a senior at Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas, majoring in Computer Science.  
This semester (Spring 2026) I'm taking **CSCI 340: Databases and Web Systems** with Dr. Goadrich.

I created this blog as part of the course labs.  
Here I'll share what I'm learning about databases, web development, Jekyll, SQL, Ruby, and more

When I'm not coding, I really enjoy walks in the park, playing Madden on the PS5, and spending time with my girlfriend. I am from Memphis originally, but right now I am living in Conway!
