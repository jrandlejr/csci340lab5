This is my new page about my athletic background!

It all started when I was 6 years old, and wanted to play football because of my big brother.
The funny thing is, I went futher than my big brother did in football with me going all the way to college lol!

The game of football taught me many lessons.
It taught me work ethic, dicipline, the will to be great at strengths and weaknesses, etc.
Even though I have hung my cleats up, I take those skills into my studies each and every day; with computer science being heavily reliant on practing outside of class. 

When I open my computer to code in my free time, it makes me feel like that 12 year old boy in 7th grade practicing drills with my trainer when every other kid goes home after practice. 

The game is truly something I cherised and even miss at times.
Overall, I have no regrets.
